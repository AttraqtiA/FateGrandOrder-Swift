🟢 Enemy Battle --!
Choose a servant to fight with first! YOUR SERVANT ATTACK FIRST, THEN THE ENEMY 
Any action/command would result in enemy attacking you, so after scanning vital, they would still attack you. EXCEPT if the Shield skill is active! If MP is not enough for Meteor or Shield, enemy would still attack. Wrong input won't make the enemy attack

Physical attack, from 5pt damage, into 100 damage
Meteor, from 50pt damage, into 250 damage
Shield still the same, all mana/MP usages doesn't change from original

So their action would now be, Physical attack, Meteor, Shield, use heal potion, use elixir potion, scan enemy's vital, and flee from battle. 
For example, if servant has 800/1000 HP, then flee from battle, they would keep that stat permanently
When you lost / defeated, the servant is gone and removed from the party array
If flee from battle or back to menu, enemy will reset 

Each enemy inheritance, has their own menu
🧌 Troll - Forest of Troll
HP : 1000, Atk : 100
Troll has 70/30 chance of dealing normal attack, or dealing 3x damage to you
Enemy drop : Gives you randomized 1-10 elixir potion + 50 SQ as a drop

🪨 Golem - Golem Mountain
HP : 1500, Atk : 100
Golem has passive healing of 10% max HP every turn
Enemy drop : Gives you randomized 1-10 heal potion + 50 SQ as a drop

🪙 [NEW] Bandit - Thief Surprise
HP : 1000, Atk : 100
Bandit steals 10 SQ every turn, literally steals your money, they won't give it back
Enemy drop : Gives you a mouthful randomized 200-500 SQ as a drop


🟢 [NEW] Versus Wild Servant --!
Choose a servant to fight with first! YOUR SERVANT ATTACK FIRST, THEN THE ENEMY WILD SERVANT
Rarity are just numbers, there's no special stats. Wild enemy servant will all have flat 3⭐ rarity.
Wild servant will always have their equipment equipped, so they can use Noble Phantasm from start, but still needs to recharge their NP_gauge to 100%
Wild servant still has random mechanic, selecting from the 7 classes (except Shielder again)
When you lost / defeated, the servant is gone and removed from the party array
If flee from battle or back to menu, enemy will reset

Physical attack, Meteor, and Shield are all Unavailable to use. MP or mana mechanic is now replaced with Noble Phantasm (NP) gauge
So their action would now be, deal servant skill, use heal potion, and flee from battle. 
For example, if servant has 800/1000 HP, then flee from battle, they would keep that stat permanently
Wrong input won't make the enemy attack!

[NEW] Noble Phantasm, can be used if equipment is true or equipped. Berserker and Shielder DON'T have unique equipment thus NP too
When the condition is met, the 0. Launch Noble Phantasm action will appear. Launching it will reset NP gauge back to 0%

As wild servant, when defeated, will drop flat 300 SQ + 5 heal potion + 5 elixir potion.

The details on each Servant skill, NP, and Type Chart is explained to the user in the [L]earn about Servants (Codex) menu! 
But here it is,
